# Pet Store Management System - Part 8

## Overview

In the PetStorePart8 project, we aimed to streamline and improve the logic for handling various products, specifically focusing on enhancing the process of fetching products by name and adding Dog Leash products in JSON format.

## Changes Made

1. **Introduced a `Validators` Folder**:
    - As our application grew, we saw the need to validate our product entities better. To achieve this, we added a `Validators` folder to separate our validation logic and make our project more modular.
  
2. **Generic Fetching**:
    - Replaced the specific method `GetDogLeashByName(string name)` with a generic `GetProductByName<T>(string name) where T : Product` method. This new method allows users to fetch any product by name, not just a `DogLeash`.

3. **Error Handling**:
    - Improved error handling by capturing validation errors. If any product fails the validation, a `ValidationException` will be thrown with details about the validation errors.

4. **Using FluentValidation**:
    - Incorporated the FluentValidation library to validate our `DogLeash` products. It offers a clean and straightforward way to define validation rules.

5. **Code Refactoring**:
    - The structure of the `ProductLogic` class was revised to provide a clearer and more maintainable codebase. Specific methods for product types were replaced with more generic implementations to accommodate future product additions seamlessly.
