# Pet Store Part 9

This project is a continuation of the Pet Store application, focusing on improving code structure and functionality. Below, we'll outline the changes made and the reasons behind them.

## Changes Made

### Code Structure and Organization

1. **Removed Unnecessary Classes**: The `DogLeash`, `CatFood`, and `DryCatFood` classes have been removed. These classes were no longer needed in the application, simplifying the codebase.

2. **Simplified ProductLogic**: The `ProductLogic` class has been simplified to include only the necessary methods for adding, retrieving, and listing products.

3. **Validation Using FluentValidation**: FluentValidation has been introduced to validate product objects before adding them to the database. This ensures data integrity and improves error handling.

4. **UI Logic Updates**: The `UILogic` class has been updated to reflect the changes in available menu options, improving user interaction.

### Database Integration

5. **Database Migration**: The application now utilizes Entity Framework Core to manage a SQLite database. You can create the database by running migrations with the `dotnet ef` command (`dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate` and `dotnet ef database update`).

6. **Product Repository Updates**: The `ProductRepository` class has been updated to interact with the SQLite database, allowing products to be stored persistently.

## Why These Changes?

- **Code Cleanup**: Unnecessary classes and methods were removed to simplify the codebase and make it more maintainable.

- **Improved Data Validation**: The introduction of FluentValidation ensures that product data is validated before being stored, reducing the risk of invalid data in the database.

- **Database Persistence**: By integrating Entity Framework Core with SQLite, the application now supports persistent data storage, allowing products to be stored between sessions.

- **Enhanced User Interaction**: The changes to the UI and menu options make the application more user-friendly and intuitive.
